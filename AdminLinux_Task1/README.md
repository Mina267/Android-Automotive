## 3. What is the difference between rm and rmdir using man command?
### a- rm
    rm removes each specified file. By default, it does not remove directories.
    If the -I or - -interactive=once option is given, and there are more
    than three files or the -r, -R, or -- recursive are given, then rm
    prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.
    If the response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.
    
### a- rmdir
    Remove the DIRECTORY(ies), if they are empty.
    -- ignore-fail-on-non-empty
        ignore each failure that is solely because a directory
        is non-empty
    -P, -- parents
        remove DIRECTORY and its ancestors; e.g., 'rmdir -p a/b/c' is similar to 'rmdir a/b/c a/b a'
    -v, -- verbose
        output a diagnostic for every directory processed
    -- help display this help and exit
    -- version
        output version information and exit
