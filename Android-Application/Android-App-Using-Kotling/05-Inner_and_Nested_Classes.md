### **Difference Between `Inner` and `Nested` Classes**

In Kotlin, **nested** and **inner** classes represent two different ways to define classes inside other classes. The key difference is whether or not the inner class has access to the members of the outer class. Let's break this down clearly.

### 1. **Nested Classes (Without `inner` Keyword)**
- A **nested class** in Kotlin is a class defined inside another class without the `inner` keyword.
- **No reference to the outer class**: A nested class does **not** have access to the members (variables, methods) of the outer class. This is similar to a static nested class in Java.
- The nested class is completely independent of the outer class, meaning it behaves like any other class but is namespaced inside the outer class for organizational purposes.

#### Example:
```kotlin
class Outer {
    private val outerProperty: Int = 42

    class Nested {
        fun nestedFunction() = "I'm inside the Nested class"
        // Cannot access outerProperty here
    }
}

fun main() {
    val nested = Outer.Nested()  // Instantiate the nested class
    println(nested.nestedFunction())  // Prints: I'm inside the Nested class
}
```

In this case, the `Nested` class cannot access any members of the `Outer` class because it doesn't hold a reference to it.

### 2. **Inner Classes (With `inner` Keyword)**
- An **inner class** in Kotlin is a nested class that is marked with the `inner` keyword.
- **Has reference to the outer class**: The inner class **can access** members of the outer class because it holds a reference to an instance of the outer class. This means the inner class is "aware" of the outer class and can use its properties and functions.

#### Example:
```kotlin
class Outer {
    private val outerProperty: Int = 42

    inner class Inner {
        fun innerFunction() = outerProperty  // Can access outerProperty
    }
}

fun main() {
    val outer = Outer()
    val inner = outer.Inner()  // You need an instance of Outer to instantiate Inner
    println(inner.innerFunction())  // Prints: 42
}
```

Here, the `Inner` class has access to the `outerProperty` because it's marked with `inner`, which gives it a reference to the instance of the `Outer` class.

### **Summary of Differences:**
| Feature            | Nested Class (No `inner`)                     | Inner Class (With `inner`)                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Access to outer class members | No                                         | Yes (Has a reference to outer class instance)  |
| Reference to outer class | No                                         | Yes                                           |
| How to instantiate  | `Outer.Nested()`                              | `Outer().Inner()`                              |
| Similarity to Java  | Similar to **static** nested class in Java    | Similar to **non-static** inner class in Java  |

### 3. **Static Companion Object vs Inner Class**

A **companion object** is used to define static-like properties and functions in Kotlin, whereas an inner class is a regular class that can access its outer class members. Let's see the difference.

#### **Companion Object:**
- Companion objects behave like static members in other languages.
- They **don’t carry a reference** to any instance of the outer class. Instead, they belong to the class itself and not to any instance.
- Companion objects are **singleton-like** and created when the class is loaded.

#### Example of Companion Object:
```kotlin
class MyClass {
    companion object {
        fun create() = MyClass()  // Static-like method
    }
}

fun main() {
    val instance = MyClass.create()  // No need for an instance of MyClass
}
```

Here, you can call `create()` directly on the class without creating an instance of `MyClass`. The companion object is shared across all instances of `MyClass`.

### **Key Differences Between Companion Object and Inner Class:**

| Feature               | Companion Object                                      | Inner Class                                      |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Reference to outer class | No (acts like a static context)                        | Yes (holds reference to outer class instance)    |
| Access to outer members | No (only class members, not instance members)          | Yes (can access all members of outer instance)   |
| Singleton-like behavior | Yes (one per class)                                   | No (new instance for each outer class instance)  |
| Purpose                | Utility or factory methods, static-like properties     | Instance-specific behavior with access to outer class |
| Instantiation          | Automatically instantiated when class is loaded        | Requires an instance of the outer class          |

### **Conclusion**
- A **nested class** (without `inner`) is independent of the outer class and cannot access its members, behaving like a static class in Java.
- An **inner class** (with `inner`) holds a reference to the outer class and can access its members.
- A **companion object** behaves like static members in Kotlin and doesn’t carry any reference to the outer class instance, but it can access private members of the class (not instance members) where it’s defined.

In Kotlin, the **`data class`** and **nested classes** don't behave the same way as static members in other languages like Java. Let's break this down:

### **Data Class and Nested Data Class Behavior**

In your example:

```kotlin
data class Person(val name: String, val address: Address) {
    data class Address(val streetName: String, val city: String, val building: Building)
    enum class Building { VILLA, APARTMENT }
}
```

1. **Data Classes**: 
   - Data classes in Kotlin are used to store state. They automatically generate useful methods like `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `copy()` for working with data.
   
2. **Nested Data Class (`Address`)**: 
   - The `Address` class inside `Person` is a **nested data class**, which means it is **tied to the `Person` class only by name** but not as a static field or shared instance.
   - Each `Person` object can have **its own unique instance** of `Address`. The nested class simply means that `Address` belongs to the `Person` type in terms of organization (scoping), not in terms of static sharing or behavior.

### **Why `Address` Isn't Shared Between `Person` Instances:**

When you create a new `Person` object like this:

```kotlin
val person = Person("Mina", Person.Address("street", "Cairo", Person.Building.VILLA))
val person2 = Person("Magdy", Person.Address("street2", "Egypt", Person.Building.APARTMENT))
```

- You are creating **new instances** of the `Address` class for each person.
- Even though `Address` is defined inside `Person`, it behaves like a normal class.
- This is because **nested classes in Kotlin are not static by default**. You can create multiple independent instances of `Address` with different values for each `Person`.

### **Why Does It Work Like This?**

The nested class `Address` is **namespaced** within `Person` but not static or shared among `Person` instances. Every time you create a new `Person`, you're creating a **new object** for `Address` as well.

The `Address` class itself is not shared between instances of `Person`; each instance of `Person` gets its own copy of `Address`. Therefore, the following objects are distinct:

```kotlin
val person = Person("Mina", Person.Address("street", "Cairo", Person.Building.VILLA))
val person2 = Person("Magdy", Person.Address("street2", "Egypt", Person.Building.APARTMENT))
```

- `person.address` and `person2.address` are **completely different instances** with different values, so changing one doesn't affect the other.

### **Static-like Behavior in Kotlin**

If you want the nested class to behave in a "static" way (shared between all instances), you'd need to define **companion objects or static fields**. However, this isn't your goal here, as you're storing different addresses for each `Person`. 

Here's an example of a static field (though this doesn't apply directly to your scenario):

```kotlin
class Person {
    companion object {
        val sharedAddress = "Shared Address"
    }
}

fun main() {
    println(Person.sharedAddress)  // "Shared Address"
}
```

In this case, `sharedAddress` is shared among all `Person` instances, but `Address` in your original example is **not static** and therefore behaves as a normal class.

### **Conclusion**

In your code, the `Address` nested class is **not static** by default, so each `Person` instance gets its own independent `Address`. You can have different addresses for different `Person` instances without the values overwriting each other because each instance has its own separate `Address` object.

In Kotlin, when you define a **nested class** (without the `inner` keyword), it behaves similarly to a **static class** in Java in that:

1. The nested class does **not hold any reference to the outer class**.
2. It behaves as if it is a standalone class, just scoped inside the outer class.

However, this does **not** make its instances automatically shared between different instances of the outer class. Each instance of the outer class can have its own instance of the nested class, just like any regular class. 

This is different from how **static fields** work in Java, where a static field is shared across all instances of the outer class.

In Kotlin, to achieve sharing of the nested class (or any class instance) across multiple outer class instances, you need to explicitly create a shared instance (like with a `companion object` or by reusing an instance). The nested class, by itself, behaves like a static class but does **not inherently share state** between instances of the outer class.

### Key Differences:

- **Static in Java:** A static nested class in Java is independent of its outer class, but if there are static fields inside it, they are shared among all instances of the outer class.
- **Nested in Kotlin:** A Kotlin nested class is independent like Java's static nested class, but without any static fields by default. Each outer class instance can create its own instance of the nested class without sharing unless you explicitly make something shared (e.g., via a `companion object`).

### Example to Illustrate:

Here's an example demonstrating that a **nested class** in Kotlin is not automatically shared between different instances:

```kotlin
class OuterClass(val name: String) {
    // Nested class (similar to Java's static class, but not shared automatically)
    class NestedClass(val value: Int)

    fun createNested(): NestedClass {
        return NestedClass(10)
    }
}

fun main() {
    val outer1 = OuterClass("Outer1")
    val outer2 = OuterClass("Outer2")

    val nested1 = outer1.createNested()
    val nested2 = outer2.createNested()

    // These two nested instances are separate, not shared
    println(nested1.value)  // Output: 10
    println(nested2.value)  // Output: 10

    // Nested instances are not the same object
    println(nested1 === nested2)  // Output: false
}
```

In the example, the `NestedClass` is created separately for each `OuterClass` instance, even though it behaves like a static class (it doesn't hold a reference to `OuterClass`). The nested class instance is **not shared** between `outer1` and `outer2` unless explicitly done so.

### To Share a Nested Class Instance:
If you want to make the nested class instance shareable, you'd need to store it in a static-like context such as a `companion object`:

```kotlin
class OuterClass(val name: String) {
    companion object {
        val sharedNested = NestedClass(10)
    }

    // Nested class (static-like)
    class NestedClass(val value: Int)
}

fun main() {
    val outer1 = OuterClass("Outer1")
    val outer2 = OuterClass("Outer2")

    // Both outer1 and outer2 share the same nested instance
    println(OuterClass.sharedNested.value)  // Output: 10
    println(OuterClass.sharedNested === OuterClass.sharedNested)  // Output: true
}
```

In this case, the `sharedNested` is accessible across all instances of `OuterClass`, and only one instance is created. This simulates a static-like field in Java, where the data is shared between all instances of the outer class.

 A **nested class** in Kotlin is not **static** in the sense of having a fixed memory space during compilation (like a static field in the `.data` section in C/C++). Here's how it works:

### Key Points about Kotlin Nested Classes:

1. **Not Automatically Static:** 
   A **nested class** (without the `inner` keyword) behaves similarly to a static class in Java in terms of scoping (i.e., it doesn't hold a reference to the outer class). However, this does **not** mean it is stored in a fixed memory location, nor is it automatically shared between instances of the outer class.

2. **No Fixed Memory Space at Compile-Time:**
   The nested class itself is just like any other class in Kotlin. You can create instances of it, and each instance will be dynamically allocated memory at runtime, just like any regular class. It does **not** have a pre-allocated memory space like static fields in lower-level languages (e.g., in the `.data` section).

3. **Independent Instances:**
   When you create objects from a nested class, they are independent instances and are not tied to the outer class unless explicitly shared (e.g., via a `companion object` or global variable). The nested class is simply a way to organize classes within another class, but its instances are created like any other class instances.

4. **Can Be Instantiated as a Standalone Class:**
   You can create instances of a nested class just like any regular class, and those instances are independent. The nested class does not rely on the outer class's instance to be instantiated.

### Example:

```kotlin
class OuterClass(val name: String) {
    // Nested class
    class NestedClass(val value: Int)
}

fun main() {
    // Creating an instance of NestedClass directly, without any OuterClass instance
    val nestedInstance = OuterClass.NestedClass(42)

    println(nestedInstance.value)  // Output: 42
}
```

In this example, `NestedClass` can be instantiated directly as if it were a standalone class. It's not tied to any specific memory location in the way that a static field would be in languages like C++ or Java.

### Static Fields vs Nested Classes:

- In **C++/C**, static fields are typically stored in the `.data` or `.bss` section, meaning they have a fixed memory allocation determined at compile-time. They exist for the lifetime of the program.
- In **Java**, static members (fields or nested classes) are loaded into memory when the class is loaded by the JVM and persist as long as the class is in memory. Static members are shared across all instances of the class.

### Kotlin's Nested Classes:

- Kotlin's **nested classes** do not have this "static" behavior. Each instance of a nested class is created and destroyed like any other object, and it's not automatically shared or stored in a fixed memory space.
- If you want static-like behavior (fixed memory, shared instance), you need to use a `companion object` or similar mechanisms.

### Summary:

- Kotlin **nested classes** behave like regular classes and do not have any special static memory allocation.
- They can be instantiated independently of the outer class and behave just like standalone objects.
- They are **not pre-allocated** or tied to a specific memory location; instead, they are created dynamically at runtime when you instantiate them.

If you need something that behaves like a static field (shared, fixed memory), you would use mechanisms like a `companion object`.
