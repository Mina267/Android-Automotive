## Parent-Child Relationships in Coroutines

In Kotlin, **coroutines can have parent-child relationships**, where the **parent coroutine** can control or affect its **child coroutines** and vice versa. The way they affect each other depends on the type of scope you use.

### 1. **Structured Concurrency (Regular Coroutine Scopes)**

When you use regular coroutine scopes (like `CoroutineScope`, `viewModelScope`, etc.), **structured concurrency** ensures that parent and child coroutines are connected.

#### How It Works:
- **Parent Coroutine**: A coroutine that launches other coroutines.
- **Child Coroutines**: Coroutines launched from within a parent coroutine.
  
In structured concurrency:
- If a **parent coroutine is cancelled**, all **child coroutines** are also cancelled automatically.
- If a **child coroutine throws an exception**, it **propagates** to the parent coroutine, and the parent gets cancelled.
- If the parent is cancelled, **all children stop working**.

**Example**:
```kotlin
val parentJob = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default).launch {
    // Child 1
    launch {
        delay(2000)
        println("Child 1 completed")
    }
    
    // Child 2
    launch {
        delay(1000)
        throw IllegalStateException("Error in Child 2")
    }
}
```
- **Child 2** throws an exception. This cancels **Child 1** and the **parent**. The parent won’t wait for **Child 1** to finish, and the entire scope is cancelled.
- **Effect**: Failure in a child affects the entire hierarchy.

### 2. **GlobalScope (Unstructured Concurrency)**

When you use `GlobalScope`, the parent-child relationship **does not exist**. **Child coroutines** are **independent** from their parents, and their lifecycles are not tied together.

#### How It Works:
- **GlobalScope** coroutines are not affected by the parent coroutine and vice versa.
- If a **child coroutine in GlobalScope throws an exception**, the parent coroutine won’t know about it, and it won’t be cancelled.
- If the **parent coroutine is cancelled**, **GlobalScope coroutines keep running**.

**Example**:
```kotlin
val parentJob = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default).launch {
    // Child 1 in GlobalScope
    GlobalScope.launch {
        delay(2000)
        println("GlobalScope Child 1 completed")
    }
    
    // Child 2 in parent scope
    launch {
        delay(1000)
        throw IllegalStateException("Error in Child 2")
    }
}
```
- **Child 2** fails and cancels the parent coroutine, but **GlobalScope Child 1** continues running because it’s independent of the parent.
- **Effect**: **GlobalScope coroutines are independent** of their parents and other children.

### 3. **SupervisionScope (Supervised Concurrency)**

In a **supervised scope**, the relationship is more lenient:
- If a **child coroutine fails**, it **does not cancel the parent** or the sibling coroutines.
- If the **parent is cancelled**, all **children are still cancelled**.

**Example**:
```kotlin
val supervisorJob = SupervisorScope().launch {
    // Child 1
    launch {
        delay(2000)
        println("Child 1 completed")
    }

    // Child 2 fails
    launch {
        delay(1000)
        throw IllegalStateException("Error in Child 2")
    }
}
```
- **Child 2** fails, but **Child 1** continues running. The **parent is not cancelled** when a child fails.
- **Effect**: Failure in a child doesn’t affect other children or the parent, but cancellation of the parent still affects all children.

### Summary:

| **Scope**                | **Child Fails**                        | **Parent Fails**                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Structured Concurrency** | Cancels parent and other children      | Cancels all children                  |
| **GlobalScope**           | Does not affect parent or other coroutines | Parent does not cancel Global coroutines |
| **SupervisionScope**      | Does not cancel parent or other children | Cancels all children                  |

### Conclusion:
- **Structured Concurrency**: Parents and children are tightly coupled—one fails, they all fail.
- **GlobalScope**: No relationship—each coroutine is independent.
- **SupervisionScope**: Flexible—children can fail without affecting the parent or siblings.

In the context of Kotlin coroutines, **lifecycle** and **exception propagation** are key concepts related to how coroutines are managed and how errors (exceptions) are handled. Let’s break down both concepts:

### 1. **Lifecycle of Coroutines**

The **lifecycle** of a coroutine refers to its **creation**, **execution**, and **completion**. In Kotlin, coroutines have a lifecycle that is tied to the **scope** in which they are launched. The scope determines when the coroutine starts, runs, and when it is cancelled or completed.

#### Key Points About Coroutine Lifecycle:
- **Creation**: A coroutine is created when it is launched using builders like `launch`, `async`, or `runBlocking`. It enters a **new** state.
  
- **Active State**: After creation, the coroutine becomes **active** and starts executing its code. It might suspend (pause) and resume later as needed (for example, when you call `delay()`).

- **Cancellation**: Coroutines can be cancelled by their parent scope or manually. When a coroutine is cancelled, all its child coroutines are also cancelled. This is particularly useful in Android development where you want coroutines to stop when a UI component (like an activity or fragment) is destroyed.

- **Completion**: Once the coroutine finishes its work (successfully or due to an error), it enters the **completed** state. If it finishes successfully, it moves to a completed state naturally. If it throws an exception, it still completes, but in a **failed** state.

#### Structured vs. Unstructured Lifecycle:

- **Structured Concurrency**: Coroutines launched in a specific scope (e.g., `CoroutineScope`, `viewModelScope`, etc.) follow structured concurrency, where child coroutines are tied to the lifecycle of the parent. When the parent scope is cancelled or completes, all child coroutines are automatically cancelled. This ensures that coroutines don't leak and keeps things well-organized.
  
  Example: A coroutine launched inside an Android `ViewModel` will be automatically cancelled when the `ViewModel` is cleared, ensuring that no background tasks keep running after the user navigates away from the screen.

- **Unstructured Concurrency**: Coroutines launched in `GlobalScope` do not follow structured concurrency and are independent of any scope. Their lifecycle is not tied to any parent scope, meaning they can outlive the scope in which they were launched, making them harder to manage.

### 2. **Exception Propagation**

**Exception propagation** refers to how exceptions thrown in coroutines are handled and how they move between coroutines in a hierarchy (parent-child relationship). 

#### Exception Handling in Coroutines:
- **Uncaught Exceptions**: If an exception is thrown inside a coroutine and isn’t handled (caught) within that coroutine, it will propagate to the parent coroutine (if any) and may cause the parent coroutine to fail.
  
- **Propagation in Structured Concurrency**: In structured concurrency, when a child coroutine throws an exception, the parent coroutine will be **cancelled** unless the exception is caught and handled. This cancellation propagates to all other child coroutines launched in the same parent scope.

  Example: If a child coroutine in a `CoroutineScope` throws an uncaught exception, the parent scope will cancel all other child coroutines in that scope, ensuring that the parent does not keep running in an invalid state.

- **Cancellation Propagation**: If a coroutine is cancelled (whether due to an exception or manually), all of its children are cancelled as well.

#### Example of Exception Propagation:
```kotlin
val parentJob = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default).launch {
    // Child 1
    launch {
        try {
            delay(Long.MAX_VALUE) // Simulate long-running work
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            println("${e.javaClass.simpleName} caught in Child 1")
        }
    }
    
    // Child 2
    launch {
        delay(1000) // Simulate some work
        throw IllegalStateException("Child 2 failure")
    }
}

parentJob.join()
```

- **Child 1**: Has a long-running job and catches any exceptions.
- **Child 2**: Throws an `IllegalStateException` after a 1-second delay.
- When **Child 2** throws the exception, it propagates to the **parentJob**.
- **Child 1** will be cancelled because the parent job is cancelled when **Child 2** fails.

Output:
```
Caught java.lang.IllegalStateException with suppressing null
```

### Summary of Exception Propagation in Structured Concurrency:
- If a child coroutine fails (throws an exception) and the exception is not caught, it propagates to the parent coroutine.
- The parent coroutine is cancelled when a child fails, and all other child coroutines in that parent scope are cancelled too.
- In structured concurrency, failure in any child coroutine affects the entire coroutine hierarchy unless exceptions are explicitly caught.

### Key Differences in Structured vs. Unstructured Concurrency:

- **Structured Concurrency**: 
  - Exception propagation is automatic. If one coroutine fails, the failure is propagated to the parent, and all other child coroutines are cancelled. This prevents resource leaks and ensures that failures are not ignored.
  - **Cancellation cascades**: If a parent coroutine is cancelled, all child coroutines are cancelled.
  
- **Unstructured Concurrency** (`GlobalScope`):
  - Exception propagation does **not** occur to other coroutines. If a coroutine in `GlobalScope` throws an exception, the parent coroutine (if any) won’t be affected.
  - **Cancellation is manual**: You have to manually handle the lifecycle of unstructured coroutines, including cancelling them if needed.

### Final Notes:
- **Lifecycle**: Determines how long a coroutine runs and when it is cancelled or completed. In structured concurrency, coroutines share the lifecycle of the parent.
- **Exception Propagation**: Determines how exceptions flow between parent and child coroutines. In structured concurrency, exceptions propagate from children to the parent and affect the entire coroutine hierarchy, while in unstructured concurrency (`GlobalScope`), coroutines are independent, and exceptions don’t propagate.
