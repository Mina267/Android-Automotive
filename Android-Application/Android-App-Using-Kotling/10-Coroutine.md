Kotlin **Coroutines** are a way to handle asynchronous programming that avoids blocking the CPU while still making it easy to write efficient, non-blocking code. Here's how coroutines work and why they don't block the CPU:

### **How Coroutines Work:**
1. **Lightweight Threads:**
   - Coroutines are not actual threads; they are lightweight, cooperative tasks that run within a single thread.
   - A coroutine can suspend itself without blocking the thread it's running on. This means other coroutines or tasks can continue to run on the same thread while one coroutine is suspended.

2. **Suspension & Resumption:**
   - When a coroutine reaches a **suspension point** (like waiting for a network request or a long computation), it **yields** the thread it's using. This is different from threads, where an ongoing task would hold the thread and block other tasks from executing.
   - After suspension, the coroutine doesn’t block the thread. Instead, it "pauses" its work and allows other coroutines or tasks to run.
   - When the suspended task is ready to continue (e.g., the network response is received), the coroutine is **resumed**, potentially on the same or a different thread.

3. **Cooperative Multitasking:**
   - Coroutines operate using **cooperative multitasking**. They only give up control voluntarily when they reach a suspension point. Unlike threads, they don’t preempt each other or cause context switching unless explicitly told to suspend or yield.

4. **Schedulers and Dispatchers:**
   - **Dispatchers** decide which thread or pool of threads the coroutine will run on. Common dispatchers are:
     - `Dispatchers.Main` – for running coroutines on the main thread (used in Android for UI operations).
     - `Dispatchers.IO` – for background tasks like I/O operations (file or network).
     - `Dispatchers.Default` – for CPU-intensive tasks.
   - The dispatcher can switch a coroutine from one thread to another, without blocking the thread itself.

### **Why Coroutines Don’t Block the CPU:**

1. **Non-blocking Suspension:**
   - When a coroutine is suspended (waiting for a result, like a database or network response), the **thread is not blocked**. This frees up the thread to perform other tasks.
   - Unlike threads, which hold resources (like CPU and memory) while sleeping or waiting for a task, coroutines release those resources during suspension. This is why coroutines are called **lightweight**.
   
2. **Efficient Use of Threads:**
   - Coroutines work with a small number of threads (even one thread can handle multiple coroutines). This efficient usage reduces context switching, which is a costly operation in multi-threading.
   - By suspending and resuming at appropriate times, coroutines let the thread execute other code instead of wasting CPU cycles waiting.

3. **Avoidance of Thread Starvation:**
   - Threads are a limited resource, and creating too many can lead to **thread starvation**, where the system runs out of threads to handle tasks.
   - Coroutines, on the other hand, run on fewer threads, avoiding the overhead associated with thread management and the risk of thread starvation.
  
4. **Structured Concurrency:**
   - Kotlin introduces **structured concurrency** with coroutines, which ensures that you don’t have "dangling" tasks or unfinished work. By encapsulating work within scopes (like `launch` or `async`), coroutines make sure the work is completed cleanly without blocking other threads or the CPU.

### **Example:**
```kotlin
fun main() = runBlocking {
    launch {
        delay(1000L)  // Suspends the coroutine, doesn't block the thread.
        println("Coroutine has resumed after 1 second.")
    }
    println("This will print immediately.")
}
```

- In this example, the `delay(1000L)` suspends the coroutine for 1 second without blocking the thread. The thread can handle other tasks, and once the delay is over, the coroutine is resumed and prints the message.

### **Summary:**
- Coroutines don’t block the CPU because they rely on **suspension** and **resumption**. When a coroutine suspends, the thread it's running on becomes free to do other work.
- Instead of blocking threads, coroutines allow other coroutines or tasks to run while they wait, leading to more efficient use of system resources (especially CPU and memory).
- Coroutines manage concurrency with much less overhead than traditional threads, which means lower CPU usage, fewer context switches, and better scalability.


The number of threads in a **coroutine thread pool** and when a coroutine changes threads are determined by a combination of predefined settings and dynamic runtime management. Let's break this down:

### 1. **Predefined Thread Pool Size:**
In Kotlin Coroutines, the size of the thread pool for different dispatchers (e.g., `Dispatchers.IO`, `Dispatchers.Default`) can be **predefined** but is also adaptable based on system needs. Here’s how it works for some common dispatchers:

#### **Dispatchers.IO:**
- **Thread Pool Size:** The default size of the `Dispatchers.IO` thread pool is based on the number of available CPU cores. However, it is **larger than the core count** because I/O-bound operations (such as network calls, file I/O) typically spend a lot of time waiting (e.g., waiting for data to be read or written). While waiting, the thread is idle and can be used by another coroutine.
  
   - By default, the pool size is `64` threads (or can scale up to 64). However, this can change dynamically.
   - You can configure the thread pool size by setting the system property `kotlinx.coroutines.io.parallelism`.

   **Example:**
   ```kotlin
   System.setProperty("kotlinx.coroutines.io.parallelism", "100")
   ```

#### **Dispatchers.Default:**
- **Thread Pool Size:** The default size of `Dispatchers.Default` is equal to the number of **CPU cores** available to the system. This dispatcher is typically used for CPU-intensive tasks, so it’s optimized for tasks like computations.
  
   - For example, on a quad-core system, `Dispatchers.Default` will create a thread pool of **4 threads** (one thread per core).
   - You can also customize the thread pool size via the system property `kotlinx.coroutines.default.parallelism`.

   **Example:**
   ```kotlin
   System.setProperty("kotlinx.coroutines.default.parallelism", "8")
   ```

### 2. **Dynamic Adjustment During Runtime:**
The number of threads in a pool can also **adjust dynamically** based on load. Kotlin Coroutines use an **elastic thread pool** model, which means that under certain circumstances, the system can **add more threads** or **reuse idle threads** to handle new coroutines efficiently.

- For instance, if many I/O-bound tasks are running on `Dispatchers.IO`, the system can temporarily increase the thread pool size (up to the predefined limit, like 64 threads) to handle all tasks in parallel. Once the tasks are done and threads become idle, the pool size can shrink back down to free up resources.

---

### 3. **Coroutine Switching Threads:**
A coroutine can switch threads **automatically** under certain conditions:

#### **When does a coroutine switch threads?**
- **Different Dispatchers:**
   If a coroutine is launched on a different dispatcher, it will run on a different thread pool. For example, if a coroutine starts on `Dispatchers.Main` (main thread) but later performs a blocking I/O task using `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`, it will **switch to a thread** from the `Dispatchers.IO` pool.

   ```kotlin
   launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
       // Runs on the main thread
       withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
           // Runs on an I/O thread
           performNetworkRequest()
       }
       // Back to the main thread
   }
   ```

- **Suspending Functions:**
   Some suspending functions (like `delay()`, `withContext()`) will yield control and allow the coroutine to be moved to a different thread from the pool once it’s ready to resume. This is not the same as "blocking" a thread; instead, the coroutine is suspended, freeing the thread for other work.

#### **Why does a coroutine switch threads?**
- Coroutines may switch threads **based on the context they need**. For example, if a coroutine needs to do **heavy computation**, it should run on `Dispatchers.Default`. But if the same coroutine also needs to perform **I/O operations**, it may switch to `Dispatchers.IO` to use a thread that is better suited for blocking I/O tasks. This way, the coroutine keeps the CPU threads free for computational work while running I/O-bound tasks on separate I/O threads.

---

### 4. **Coroutine Context and Thread Switching:**
You can manually control coroutine thread switching using **coroutine contexts** with `withContext()`.

- **Example of switching between threads:**
   ```kotlin
   launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
       println("Running on Main: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
       withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
           println("Switched to IO: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
           performFileRead()
       }
       println("Back to Main: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
   }
   ```

In this example:
1. The coroutine starts on the **Main thread** (UI thread).
2. It switches to an **IO thread** from the `Dispatchers.IO` pool to perform file reading (an I/O operation).
3. After the I/O task is complete, the coroutine switches **back to the Main thread** to continue execution.

---

### 5. **How does this improve efficiency?**
Because coroutines don’t block threads, many coroutines can run on a small number of threads. For instance, while a coroutine waits for a network response, its thread can be reused to run another coroutine. This allows Kotlin’s coroutines to handle large numbers of concurrent tasks more efficiently than traditional threads.

---

### **Summary:**
- The number of threads in the coroutine thread pool is **predefined** but can be **dynamically adjusted** during runtime based on system load and task requirements.
- **`Dispatchers.IO`** has a larger pool (default up to 64 threads) because I/O tasks typically involve waiting, while **`Dispatchers.Default`** is limited to the number of CPU cores (e.g., 4 threads on a quad-core CPU).
- Coroutines can **switch threads** when using different dispatchers or when suspending and resuming work based on the context (like switching between `Dispatchers.Main` and `Dispatchers.IO`).
- The flexibility and efficiency of coroutines come from their ability to **share threads** and **suspend** without blocking, allowing many coroutines to run concurrently on a small number of threads.
