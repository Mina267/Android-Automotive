### Meaning of **Top Level**:

In many programming languages (including Kotlin), **Top Level** refers to elements that are declared **outside of any class or function**. These are elements that exist at the highest level of the code hierarchy, often making them globally accessible within their scope.

- **Top Level Functions**: Functions defined outside of a class.
- **Top Level Properties**: Variables or constants defined outside any class or function.
- **Top Level Classes**: Classes declared outside of any other class or function.

For example:
```kotlin
// Top-level function
fun greet() {
    println("Hello!")
}

// Top-level property
val language = "Kotlin"

// Top-level class
class MyClass {
    fun printMessage() {
        println("Top level class method")
    }
}
```
Top-level elements are usually not tied to any particular class and can be used globally in the file or module where they are declared.

### Difference Between **`final`** and **`sealed`** Class:

1. **`final` Class**:
   - **Definition**: A `final` class is a class that **cannot be inherited** from. Once a class is marked `final`, no other class can extend (or inherit) from it.
   - **Usage**: It is used when you want to restrict modification or inheritance of a class, to protect its behavior and implementation.
   - **Key Point**: Once a class is declared as `final`, it can no longer be extended, ensuring that its functionality remains unchanged.

   **Example**:
   ```kotlin
   final class Animal {
       fun sound() {
           println("Animal sound")
       }
   }

   // This would give an error
   // class Dog : Animal() {}
   ```

2. **`sealed` Class**:
   - **Definition**: A `sealed` class is a type of class that **restricts the hierarchy of classes that can inherit from it**. It allows you to have a controlled set of subclasses that can extend it. All possible subclasses of a `sealed` class must be defined in the same file where the `sealed` class is declared.
   - **Usage**: It is typically used for **representing restricted class hierarchies** (like when creating an enum-like class hierarchy) where you want to control which classes are allowed to inherit from the `sealed` class.
   - **Key Point**: A `sealed` class allows extension but only by the specific classes defined within the same file. This helps in creating more predictable code structures, such as when representing different states or types of a limited category.

   **Example**:
   ```kotlin
   sealed class Result {
       class Success(val data: String) : Result()
       class Error(val message: String) : Result()
   }

   // The following would give an error since it's not declared in the same file
   // class NotAllowed : Result() {}
   ```

### Summary of Differences:
| **Aspect**          | **`final` Class**                                    | **`sealed` Class**                                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inheritance**      | Cannot be extended (no subclasses allowed).          | Can be extended, but only by classes defined in the same file. |
| **Usage**            | Used to prevent inheritance and modification of the class. | Used to limit and control which classes can inherit from it.  |
| **Example**          | Preventing subclasses entirely.                     | Representing a limited set of known subclasses (e.g., for states or types). |
