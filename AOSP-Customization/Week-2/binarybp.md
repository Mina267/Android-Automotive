Let’s go deeper into each attribute of `cc_binary` and `cc_library` with additional examples and explanations to show how you can customize and fine-tune this configuration. 

### 1. Setting up the **Binary Service** (`cc_binary`)

The `cc_binary` module is used to build a standalone binary that runs as a service on the device. This binary can be set to launch at boot using an `init.rc` file. Here’s an example with additional detail for each attribute.

#### Example of `cc_binary` Module

```plaintext
cc_binary {
    name: "my_custom_service",
    srcs: ["service/my_custom_service.cpp", "service/utils/helper.cpp"],  // Main and helper source files
    cflags: ["-Wall", "-O2", "-DLOG_TAG=\"MyService\""],  // Additional compiler flags
    static_libs: ["libutils", "libbinder", "my_custom_lib"], // Static libraries needed by the binary
    shared_libs: ["libcutils", "liblog"], // Shared libraries dynamically loaded at runtime
    init_rc: ["init.my_custom_service.rc"], // Custom init.rc file for service setup
    vendor: true, // Indicates that this binary is for vendor partition (for vendor-specific services)
}
```

#### Attribute Breakdown

1. **`name`**: The name of the binary module, which becomes the name of the final binary file. It’s usually set to match the service name.
   
2. **`srcs`**: A list of source files for the binary. You can include paths to multiple `.cpp` files, allowing modular code.
   - Example: `srcs: ["service/main.cpp", "service/utils/*.cpp"]` will include both the main file and any helpers under `utils`.

3. **`cflags`**: Compiler flags to adjust how the source code compiles.
   - Example: `-O2` for optimization, `-DLOG_TAG=\"MyService\"` to define a logging tag.
   - These flags can include optimizations, logging macros, or warnings, e.g., `-Wall` for all warnings.

4. **`static_libs`**: Lists static libraries that the service requires. Static libraries are linked into the binary at compile time.
   - Example: `["libutils", "libbinder", "libcustom_static"]` would include these libraries statically, ensuring they are part of the final binary.

5. **`shared_libs`**: Lists shared libraries that are loaded at runtime. They remain separate from the binary and reduce the final binary’s size.
   - Example: `["libcutils", "liblog"]` specifies runtime-linked libraries, which will only be loaded when the binary runs.

6. **`init_rc`**: The `init.rc` file for configuring the service to start on boot, set permissions, and manage service attributes.
   - The file typically specifies the service’s boot behavior, user and group ownership, and permissions.

7. **`vendor`**: Set to `true` if the binary is specific to the vendor partition, commonly used for hardware-related services in vendor-specific implementations (e.g., automotive).

#### Detailed `init.rc` Example (`init.my_custom_service.rc`)

```plaintext
service my_custom_service /vendor/bin/my_custom_service
    class main
    user system            # Run as the system user
    group system           # Group permissions
    capabilities NET_BIND_SERVICE  # Specific permissions for networking
    disabled               # Starts only when enabled
    oneshot                # Runs once and exits
    seclabel u:r:my_custom_service:s0  # SELinux label
```

Explanation:
- **`service my_custom_service /vendor/bin/my_custom_service`**: Declares the service and its executable path.
- **`class main`**: The service is part of the `main` class, meaning it can start with system services.
- **`user system`** and **`group system`**: Runs the service as the `system` user and group.
- **`capabilities NET_BIND_SERVICE`**: Grants specific permissions, such as network binding.
- **`disabled`** and **`oneshot`**: Starts only when triggered, and runs once instead of continuously.

### 2. Setting up a **Native Library** (`cc_library`)

A native library can be defined with `cc_library`, which provides additional modular functionality for your service. The library can be either shared or static, and is referenced in `cc_binary`’s `static_libs` or `shared_libs`.

#### Example of `cc_library` Module

```plaintext
cc_library {
    name: "my_custom_lib",
    srcs: ["src/core/custom_lib.cpp", "src/utils/helper.cpp"],  // Source files for the library
    shared_libs: ["libc", "libm"],  // Libraries required by this library
    stl: "libc++",  // C++ standard library (libc++)
    include_dirs: ["include"],  // Directory for header files
    vendor_available: true,  // Make library accessible in vendor partition
    sdk_version: "current",  // Compatible with current SDK version
}
```

#### Attribute Breakdown

1. **`name`**: The library’s name, which becomes the filename of the resulting `.so` (shared) or `.a` (static) library.
   
2. **`srcs`**: The source files to compile into the library.
   - Example: `["src/core/custom_lib.cpp", "src/utils/helper.cpp"]`.

3. **`shared_libs`**: Shared libraries needed by this library.
   - Example: `["libc", "libm"]` links the standard C and math libraries.

4. **`stl`**: Specifies the C++ standard library (e.g., `libc++`, `none`).
   - `stl: "libc++"` makes this library use the standard C++ library (`libc++`), a common setting for C++ libraries.

5. **`include_dirs`**: Specifies directories containing header files. Useful when including external or shared headers.
   - Example: `include_dirs: ["include"]` points to a folder where all header files are stored.

6. **`vendor_available`**: Makes the library available in the vendor partition, meaning it can be used by other vendor-specific binaries.

7. **`sdk_version`**: Specifies the SDK version compatibility. `current` is typically used to indicate compatibility with the latest SDK.

### Example Usage in a Custom Vendor Implementation

Imagine you’re building a service for an **automotive system**. The service interacts with hardware via custom vendor APIs, and it must start at boot with specific permissions.

Here’s how you might set up your `Android.bp` file:

```plaintext
cc_binary {
    name: "car_control_service",
    srcs: ["car_control/main.cpp", "car_control/manager.cpp"],
    cflags: ["-Wall", "-DDEBUG"],
    static_libs: ["libhardware", "libcustom_automotive_lib"],
    shared_libs: ["liblog", "libutils"],
    init_rc: ["init.car_control_service.rc"],
    vendor: true,
}

cc_library {
    name: "libcustom_automotive_lib",
    srcs: ["lib/automotive/control.cpp"],
    include_dirs: ["include"],
    shared_libs: ["libc", "libm"],
    vendor_available: true,
    sdk_version: "current",
}
```

And your `init.rc` file (`init.car_control_service.rc`):

```plaintext
service car_control_service /vendor/bin/car_control_service
    class main
    user system
    group system input  # Requires access to the input group for hardware controls
    capabilities NET_BIND_SERVICE SYS_ADMIN  # Specific permissions for networking and admin
    disabled
    oneshot
    seclabel u:r:car_control_service:s0
```

This setup:
- Defines a binary service (`car_control_service`) that relies on `libcustom_automotive_lib`.
- The `car_control_service` service has permissions for network binding and system administration, specific to the automotive domain.
- `libcustom_automotive_lib` is a library with functions essential for automotive control, accessible in the vendor partition (`vendor_available: true`).

This approach modularizes the binary and its dependencies, allowing you to manage the service as part of a larger, customizable automotive system.
