# Package manager Role in Yocto
To fully understand the role of the package manager in Yocto, let's delve into the different aspects of how it works, how it interacts with the build system, and the implications of choosing different `PACKAGE_CLASSES`.

### 1. **Role of the Package Manager in Yocto**
In Yocto, the package manager is responsible for packaging the files produced by the build process into binary packages. These packages are later used to create the final root filesystem (rootfs) image. The package manager defines how the files are organized, distributed, and installed in the target system.

### 2. **Work Directory and Packaging Process**
When you build a recipe in Yocto, it goes through several stages, including fetching, unpacking, patching, configuring, compiling, and installing. The output of these stages is placed in a specific work directory, typically located under `tmp/work/` in the build directory. The files are staged in this directory, organized by package name, version, machine, and architecture.

The packaging process takes files from this work directory and organizes them into binary packages. These packages are then stored in a package feed directory, typically found under `tmp/deploy/rpm/`, `tmp/deploy/deb/`, or `tmp/deploy/ipk/` depending on the chosen package format.

### 3. **How Files are Moved to the Root Filesystem**
The process of moving files from the work directory to the root filesystem involves several steps:

- **do_install()**: This task is responsible for placing the compiled binaries and other necessary files (like configuration files, libraries, etc.) into the appropriate directories within the work directory. It replicates the structure of the target root filesystem within the work directory.

- **do_package()**: This task packages the files installed by `do_install()` into binary packages. It involves creating the package metadata (e.g., control scripts, dependencies, file lists) and compressing the files into a package format (RPM, DEB, IPK).

- **do_rootfs()**: During the image creation process, Yocto uses the binary packages to construct the root filesystem. The package manager installs the selected packages (from `IMAGE_INSTALL`) into the rootfs. The package manager uses the metadata to place files into the correct locations within the root filesystem.

### 4. **RPM Files in the Deploy Directory**
When you set `PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_rpm"`, Yocto uses the RPM package manager to create binary packages. The RPM files in the `deploy` directory are the output of the packaging process. These files contain the compiled software, configuration files, and metadata. They can be installed on the target system or used to create the root filesystem.

### 5. **Image Creation and File Placement**
When Yocto creates an image, it uses the package manager to install the selected packages into a staging area that will become the root filesystem. The package manager decides where to place files based on the metadata and the package’s installation scripts. This is why the `do_install()` task is crucial—if it installs files into incorrect locations, the final image will be broken.

The placement of files like `/opt/` (a directory often used for optional or third-party software) depends on the package’s installation scripts and the specific software being installed. If a package specifies that certain files should go into `/opt/`, the package manager will follow these instructions during the image creation process.

### 6. **Choosing Between Different PACKAGE_CLASSES**
The `PACKAGE_CLASSES` variable determines which package format Yocto uses to create binary packages. Common options are:

- **`package_rpm`**: Uses RPM to create `.rpm` packages. RPM is the default package manager for Red Hat-based distributions like Fedora and CentOS.
  
- **`package_deb`**: Uses dpkg to create `.deb` packages. This is the default for Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu.

- **`package_ipk`**: Uses opkg to create `.ipk` packages, commonly used in embedded systems.

When you choose different values for `PACKAGE_CLASSES`, it affects:

- **Package Format**: The binary packages will have different formats (`.rpm`, `.deb`, `.ipk`).
- **Package Management**: The package manager and tools (e.g., `rpm`, `dpkg`) used on the target system will differ.
- **Image Creation**: The root filesystem creation process uses the corresponding package management tools to install packages.

Choosing between these options mainly depends on the target system’s needs. For example, if you're working with a system that uses RPM-based package management, you should use `package_rpm`.

### 7. **Changes with Different PACKAGE_CLASSES**
- **File Structure**: Different package formats may have slightly different conventions or expectations for where files should be placed.
- **Metadata**: The metadata and control scripts used by RPM, DEB, and IPK packages differ. This can affect post-install scripts, dependency handling, and other package management tasks.
- **Package Management**: The tools available on the target system for managing packages will change. For instance, with RPM, you’ll use `rpm` and `yum`, while with DEB, you’ll use `dpkg` and `apt`.

### Conclusion
Understanding the package manager’s role in Yocto involves grasping how it takes files from the work directory, packages them, and installs them into the root filesystem. The choice of `PACKAGE_CLASSES` determines the package format and influences how files are placed and managed on the target system. By thoroughly managing tasks like `do_install()`, `do_package()`, and `do_rootfs()`, Yocto ensures that the final image is correctly structured and fully functional.
