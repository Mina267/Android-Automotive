# the Yocto build process
Break down each of the major tasks (`do_fetch`, `do_unpack`, `do_patch`, `do_configure`, `do_compile`, `do_install`, `do_package`, and `do_rootfs`) in detail, along with their associated variables and concepts. This will include the role of RPM files, image creation, file placement, and the use of directories like `/opt`, `/bin`, and `/usr`.

### **1. do_fetch() Task: Downloading Source Code**

#### **Purpose**
The `do_fetch()` task is responsible for downloading the source code or other files specified by the recipe from remote or local locations. These files are defined by the `SRC_URI` variable.

#### **Key Variables**
- **`SRC_URI`**: Specifies the source locations (URLs or file paths) from which the source code or other necessary files should be fetched. Multiple URIs can be specified, and each can be associated with different protocols like `http`, `https`, `git`, `file`, etc.

- **`DL_DIR`**: The directory where downloaded files are stored. Yocto uses this directory to cache downloaded files so that they don't need to be fetched again if the same file is required in future builds.

#### **Process**
1. **Fetching Source Files**: Yocto reads the `SRC_URI` to determine where to fetch the files. For example:
   ```bash
   SRC_URI = "https://example.com/source.tar.gz;md5sum=abc123"
   ```
   This line tells Yocto to fetch the `source.tar.gz` file from the specified URL.

2. **Storing Files**: The fetched files are stored in `DL_DIR`, which is typically set to `tmp/downloads/` in the build directory. This caching mechanism ensures efficiency in builds by avoiding redundant downloads.

3. **Checksum Verification**: Yocto often requires a checksum (e.g., `md5sum`) for files specified in `SRC_URI`. After fetching the file, it verifies the checksum to ensure the file hasn't been tampered with or corrupted.

### **2. do_unpack() Task: Unpacking the Source**

#### **Purpose**
The `do_unpack()` task unpacks the fetched source files into the work directory, making them ready for patching and compilation.

#### **Key Variables**
- **`WORKDIR`**: The directory where all the build-related files are placed for a specific recipe. This includes the unpacked source code, patches, and intermediate files created during the build process.

- **`S`**: The directory within `WORKDIR` where the unpacked source code resides. By default, `S` is set to `${WORKDIR}/${PN}-${PV}`, where `PN` is the package name, and `PV` is the package version.

#### **Process**
1. **Unpacking**: The source files specified in `SRC_URI` are unpacked into `WORKDIR`. If the source is a tarball, it is extracted using tools like `tar`, `gzip`, or `bzip2`.

2. **Source Directory (`S`)**: Once unpacked, Yocto sets the `S` variable to point to the directory where the source code resides. This directory is typically where the `configure` script or `Makefile` is located, which will be used in subsequent tasks.

### **3. do_patch() Task: Applying Patches**

#### **Purpose**
The `do_patch()` task applies patches to the unpacked source code. Patches are often used to fix issues, modify behavior, or adapt the source code to different environments.

#### **Key Variables**
- **`S`**: The directory where the source code is located, as defined in `do_unpack()`.

- **`PATCHES`**: A list of patch files specified in `SRC_URI` that need to be applied to the source code.

- **`PATCHTOOL`**: The tool used to apply patches, such as `patch` or `quilt`. Yocto automatically selects the appropriate tool based on the patches specified.

#### **Process**
1. **Identifying Patches**: Yocto looks for patch files specified in `SRC_URI` and listed in the `PATCHES` variable.

2. **Applying Patches**: The `do_patch()` task applies each patch in sequence to the source code in the `S` directory using the `PATCHTOOL`. For example:
   ```bash
   SRC_URI = "https://example.com/source.tar.gz \
              file://fix-bug.patch \
              file://add-feature.patch"
   ```
   In this example, both `fix-bug.patch` and `add-feature.patch` will be applied to the source code.

3. **Handling Conflicts**: If a patch fails to apply, Yocto stops the build process and reports an error, allowing the developer to resolve the conflict.

### **4. do_configure() Task: Configuring the Build**

#### **Purpose**
The `do_configure()` task configures the source code for compilation. This typically involves running configuration scripts (e.g., `./configure`) to set up compiler flags, paths, and other options needed for building the software.

#### **Key Variables**
- **`S`**: The directory where the source code resides and where the configuration script is located.

- **`CFLAGS`**: Compiler flags used to control the behavior of the C compiler. These might include optimization levels, debugging information, or architecture-specific options.

- **`CPPFLAGS`**: Preprocessor flags used by the C/C++ preprocessor, often to include directories or define macros.

- **`LDFLAGS`**: Linker flags used to control the behavior of the linker, such as specifying library paths or linking options.

- **`BUILD_SYS`**: The system on which the build is taking place (build machine).

- **`HOST_SYS`**: The system for which the software is being built (target machine).

- **`TARGET_SYS`**: The system on which the compiled software will run (target architecture).

#### **Process**
1. **Running the Configure Script**: If the source code includes a `configure` script (as in many GNU autoconf-based projects), `do_configure()` runs this script to generate the Makefiles or other build configuration files. The script uses `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS`, and `LDFLAGS` to tailor the build process.

2. **Setting Build, Host, and Target**: Yocto uses `BUILD_SYS`, `HOST_SYS`, and `TARGET_SYS` to correctly configure cross-compilation. For example, building software for an ARM target on an x86 host involves setting these variables appropriately to ensure the right tools and flags are used.

3. **Creating Configuration Files**: The output of this task typically includes Makefiles, config.h files, or other build instructions that guide the `do_compile()` task.

### **5. do_compile() Task: Compiling the Source Code**

#### **Purpose**
The `do_compile()` task compiles the source code into executable binaries, libraries, or other compiled artifacts. This task is essential as it converts the human-readable source code into machine-readable binaries.

#### **Key Variables**
- **`S`**: The directory where the source code and configuration files are located.

- **`B`**: The build directory. In some cases, Yocto uses a separate build directory (`B`) distinct from the source directory (`S`). This allows for out-of-source builds, which keep the source directory clean.

- **`CFLAGS`**, **`CPPFLAGS`**, **`LDFLAGS`**: The same flags used in `do_configure()` are also used during compilation to control how the code is compiled and linked.

#### **Process**
1. **Compilation**: The `do_compile()` task typically invokes `make` or another build tool to compile the source code. For example:
   ```bash
   do_compile() {
       oe_runmake
   }
   ```
   The `oe_runmake` function runs `make` with the appropriate environment variables and flags.

2. **Handling Errors**: If any errors occur during compilation, the task fails, and Yocto provides logs to help diagnose the issue.

3. **Output**: The output of `do_compile()` includes compiled binaries, libraries, object files, and other artifacts, typically placed in subdirectories of `B` or `S`.

### **6. do_install() Task: Installing Compiled Files**

#### **Purpose**
The `do_install()` task installs the compiled binaries, libraries, headers, and other necessary files into a staging area (`D`) that mimics the target root filesystem. This is a critical step in preparing the software for packaging.

#### **Key Variables**
- **`D`**: The directory where the files are installed during the build process. It mimics the root filesystem structure of the target system.

- **`bindir`**, **`libdir`**, **`includedir`**, **`sysconfdir`**: Standard directories within `D` where binaries, libraries, headers, and configuration files are installed. For example, `bindir` is typically set to `${D}/usr/bin`.

- **`PN`**: The package name, used to organize files within `D`.

#### **Process**
1. **Installing Files**: The `do_install()` task typically runs `make install` or a similar command to install the compiled files into `D`. For example:
   ```bash
   do_install() {
       oe_runmake install DESTDIR=${D}
   }
   ```
   The `DESTDIR` variable is used to redirect the installation paths into the `D` directory, rather than the actual root filesystem.

2. **Organizing Files**: The files are installed into subdirectories of `D
` according to the FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard). Common directories include:
   - **`${D}/usr/bin`**: Binaries.
   - **`${D}/usr/lib`**: Libraries.
   - **`${D}/usr/include`**: Headers.
   - **`${D}/etc`**: Configuration files.

3. **Custom Installation Logic**: If the software requires custom installation steps (e.g., moving files, renaming directories), these are handled within the `do_install()` task.

### **7. do_package() Task: Packaging the Files**

#### **Purpose**
The `do_package()` task packages the files installed by `do_install()` into binary packages (e.g., RPM, DEB, IPK). These packages are then stored in the deploy directory and can be installed on the target system or used to create the root filesystem.

#### **Process**
1. **Creating Packages**: Yocto uses the `do_package()` task to create binary packages. The files in `D` are packaged into `.rpm`, `.deb`, or `.ipk` files, depending on the `PACKAGE_CLASSES` setting.

2. **Generating Metadata**: The packaging process involves generating metadata, including file lists, dependencies, and post-install scripts. This metadata is crucial for the package manager to correctly install, upgrade, or remove packages on the target system.

3. **Storing Packages**: The generated packages are stored in the `tmp/deploy/rpm/`, `tmp/deploy/deb/`, or `tmp/deploy/ipk/` directory, depending on the package format.

### **8. do_rootfs() Task: Creating the Root Filesystem**

#### **Purpose**
The `do_rootfs()` task constructs the final root filesystem (rootfs) image that will be deployed to the target device. It involves installing the binary packages created by `do_package()` into a staging area, which is then used to create the final image.

#### **Process**
1. **Installing Packages**: Yocto uses the package manager (e.g., `rpm`, `dpkg`, `opkg`) to install the selected packages into the root filesystem staging area. This is done according to the list of packages specified in `IMAGE_INSTALL`.

2. **Building the Root Filesystem**: The packages are unpacked and installed into the rootfs staging area, creating a complete filesystem structure. This includes directories like `/bin`, `/usr`, `/lib`, `/opt`, etc.

3. **Creating the Final Image**: Once all packages are installed, Yocto uses tools like `mkfs.ext4`, `mkfs.ubifs`, or `dd` to create the final root filesystem image (e.g., `.ext4`, `.ubifs`). This image can be flashed onto the target device.

### **9. Role of RPM Files in Deploy**

When `PACKAGE_CLASSES = "package_rpm"` is set, the `do_package()` task creates RPM packages. These RPM files are stored in the `tmp/deploy/rpm/` directory and contain the binaries, libraries, and configuration files generated during the build. These RPM files are crucial for constructing the root filesystem and can also be used for package management on the target system.

### **10. Image Creation and File Placement**

During the `do_rootfs()` task, the package manager installs the RPM packages into a root filesystem staging area. The file placement within this root filesystem follows the FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard):

- **`/bin`**: Essential command binaries (e.g., `ls`, `cp`).
- **`/usr/bin`**: Non-essential command binaries (e.g., user applications).
- **`/lib`**: Essential shared libraries.
- **`/usr/lib`**: Non-essential shared libraries.
- **`/opt`**: Optional or third-party software, often used for large, self-contained packages that do not fit neatly into the `/usr` hierarchy.
- **`/etc`**: Configuration files.

### **Conclusion**

The Yocto build process is a detailed sequence of tasks, each responsible for a specific aspect of building, packaging, and assembling a Linux system. Understanding these tasks, from `do_fetch()` to `do_rootfs()`, provides insight into how Yocto takes source code, compiles it, and packages it into a deployable image. The choice of packaging format (RPM, DEB, IPK) and the organization of the root filesystem play a critical role in ensuring that the final image is correctly structured and functional for the target system.
