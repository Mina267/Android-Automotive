# Understanding Yocto Build Directory Structure and Functions

When working with Yocto, certain functions like `do_compile`, `do_install`, and `do_configure` are critical to the build process. If you do not override these functions in your Bitbake recipe, Yocto will use weak default implementations. These default functions might not perform the specific actions required for your application, leading to incomplete or empty build outputs.

### Directory Structure Overview

In the Yocto build environment, the main working directory is defined as:

```bash
WORKDIR="/home/mina/yocto/poky/build/tmp/work/cortexa57-poky-linux/mina/1.0-r0"
```

Under this `WORKDIR`, you will find several important subdirectories:

- **`S`**: The source directory where the unpacked source code is located.
- **`B`**: The build directory where the compilation takes place. It may or may not be the same as `S`, depending on whether an in-source or out-of-source build is used.
- **`D`**: The destination directory where files are staged for installation before being packaged.

### Locating the `S` Directory

The `S` directory contains the expanded source code, which you can find at:

```bash
S="/home/mina/yocto/poky/build/tmp/work/cortexa57-poky-linux/mina/1.0-r0/mina-1.0"
```

If your source is fetched from a Git repository, it might be placed under a `git` folder within `S`:

```bash
/home/mina/yocto/poky/build/tmp/work/cortexa57-poky-linux/mina/1.0-r0/mina-1.0/git
```

### Why is the `image` Folder Empty?

If the `image` folder in your build output is empty, it is likely because the `do_compile` function is not correctly defined or is using a weak default implementation. To generate the necessary compiled files, you need to provide a custom `do_compile` function in your recipe. Here's a simple example:
- This customization ensures that your source code is compiled and that the resulting binaries or other output files are placed in the `image` directory.



Here's a brief explanation of the Bitbake commands you're interested in, which you can include in your README file:

## Useful Bitbake Commands

Bitbake is the build tool used in Yocto to execute tasks defined in recipes. Below are some common Bitbake commands you can use to manage your builds:

### 1. Clean the Build Output: `bitbake -c cleanall <recipe>`
This command cleans all the build output associated with the specified recipe, including any downloaded source files, compiled objects, and packaging files. It's useful when you want to ensure a fresh build of a recipe.

```bash
bitbake -c cleanall <recipe>
```

### 2. List All Tasks: `bitbake -c listtasks <recipe>`
This command lists all the tasks that can be executed for a given recipe. It shows the sequence of tasks, such as `do_fetch`, `do_unpack`, `do_compile`, `do_install`, etc. This is useful for understanding the build process and what actions are available.

```bash
bitbake -c listtasks <recipe>
```

### 3. Show All Available Tasks
When you use the `-c` option followed by a task, Bitbake allows you to execute that specific task. Some common tasks you can run include:

- **fetch**: Downloads the source files.
- **unpack**: Unpacks the source files into the `S` directory.
- **patch**: Applies patches to the source files.
- **configure**: Configures the source code to be built.
- **compile**: Compiles the source code.
- **install**: Installs the compiled code into the destination directory (`D`).
- **package**: Packages the built software.

To execute any of these tasks, you can use:

```bash
bitbake -c <task> <recipe>
```

For example, to only compile a recipe, you could run:

```bash
bitbake -c compile <recipe>
```
