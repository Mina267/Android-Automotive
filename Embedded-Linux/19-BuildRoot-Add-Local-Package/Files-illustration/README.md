MINA_PACKAGE_VERSION = 1.0
MINA_PACKAGE_SITE = package/Mina_package
MINA_PACKAGE_SITE_METHOD = local
```

### Version and Source Location
- `MINA_PACKAGE_VERSION = 1.0`: This line defines the version of the `Mina_package` as 1.0.
- `MINA_PACKAGE_SITE = package/Mina_package`: This specifies the location of the package source files. Since `MINA_PACKAGE_SITE_METHOD` is `local`, it indicates that the source files are in a local directory named `package/Mina_package`.
- `MINA_PACKAGE_SITE_METHOD = local`: This tells the build system that the package source files are located locally, not to be downloaded from a remote site.

### Build Commands
```makefile
define MINA_PACKAGE_BUILD_CMDS
    $(MAKE) CC="$(TARGET_CC)" -C $(@D)
endef
```
- `define MINA_PACKAGE_BUILD_CMDS ... endef`: This block defines the commands to build the `Mina_package`.
- `$(MAKE) CC="$(TARGET_CC)" -C $(@D)`: This command runs `make` in the directory where the package source files are located (`$(@D)`). `CC="$(TARGET_CC)"` sets the compiler to the target cross-compiler, ensuring the package is built for the correct architecture.

### Installation Commands
```makefile
define MINA_PACKAGE_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS
    $(INSTALL) -D -m 0755 $(@D)/mina_app $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin/mina_app
endef
```
- `define MINA_PACKAGE_INSTALL_TARGET_CMDS ... endef`: This block defines the commands to install the `Mina_package`.
- `$(INSTALL) -D -m 0755 $(@D)/mina_app $(TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin/mina_app`: This command installs the built application (`mina_app`) to the target directory (`$(TARGET_DIR)/usr/bin/mina_app`). 
  - `-D` creates any necessary directories.
  - `-m 0755` sets the permissions of the installed file to be readable and executable by everyone, but only writable by the owner.

### Evaluating the Package
```makefile
$(eval $(generic-package))
```
- `$(eval $(generic-package))`: This line tells the build system to process the package using the generic-package infrastructure provided by Buildroot or similar build systems. This macro includes all the necessary steps (fetching, extracting, configuring, building, installing) based on the defined commands.

### Putting it all together:
1. **Version and Location**: The package is version 1.0 and its source files are located in `package/Mina_package`.
2. **Build Process**: During the build, the `make` command is invoked in the package directory using the target cross-compiler.
3. **Installation Process**: After building, the `mina_app` executable is installed into the `/usr/bin` directory of the target filesystem with the appropriate permissions.
4. **Generic Package Handling**: The `generic-package` macro handles the overall build process using the defined commands.
