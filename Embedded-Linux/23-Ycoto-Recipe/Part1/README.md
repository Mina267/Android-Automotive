### **1. Introduction to Yocto Recipes**
- **What is a Yocto Recipe?**
  - A Yocto recipe is a crucial set of instructions written in the BitBake language. It defines how a particular package is built, from fetching the source code to configuring, compiling, and packaging it.
  - Recipes are fundamental to the Yocto Project as they encapsulate the steps needed to transform source code into a binary package that can be installed on the target device.
  
- **Understanding BitBake and Its Role in Yocto**
  - BitBake is the build engine used by Yocto to interpret and execute recipe instructions. It processes these recipes to generate output in the form of packages ready for deployment on the target system.
  - BitBake also manages the dependency chain, ensuring that all required components are built in the correct order. This build engine is responsible for expanding variables, managing tasks, and handling configurations.

### **2. Key Local Variables in Yocto Recipes**

- **Mandatory Variables**
  - **LICENSE**
    - Specifies the software license under which the package is distributed.
    - Example: `LICENSE = "MIT"`
    - Accurate specification of the license is mandatory, and common licenses can be found in `poky/meta/files/common-licenses`.

  - **LIC_FILES_CHKSUM**
    - Ensures the integrity of the license file by specifying its MD5 checksum.
    - Example: `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COREBASE}/meta/files/common-licenses/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302"`
    - This is required unless the `LICENSE` is set to `CLOSED`.

- **Optional Variables**
  - **DESCRIPTION**
    - Provides a detailed description of what the package does.
    - Example: `DESCRIPTION = "This is a simple utility for managing files"`
  
  - **HOMEPAGE**
    - Specifies the URL to the project’s homepage.
    - Example: `HOMEPAGE = "http://example.com"`
  
  - **SECTION**
    - Categorizes the package within the system.
    - Example: `SECTION = "utilities"`
  
  - **DEPENDS**
    - Lists other packages that must be built before this one, ensuring all dependencies are met.
    - Example: `DEPENDS = "openssl"`
  
  - **SUMMARY**
    - A brief summary of the package’s functionality.
    - Example: `SUMMARY = "File management utility"`

### **3. Fetching Source Files with SRC_URI**

- **Understanding SRC_URI**
  - The `SRC_URI` variable is foundational in any recipe, defining where the source code or other files needed to build the package are located.
  - The correct use of this variable is critical to ensuring that BitBake can fetch the necessary resources.

- **Schema Types**:
  - **Local File**: `file://`
  - **Git Repository**: `git://`
  - **HTTP/HTTPS**: `https://`
  - **Example Configurations**:
    ```bash
    SRC_URI = "git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/dtc/dtc.git;branch=master"
    SRC_URI = "https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/network/${BPN}/${BP}.tar.xz"
    ```

- **SRCREV**: This variable is essential when fetching from a Git repository to specify a particular commit.
  - Example: `SRCREV = "b6910bec11614980a21e46fbccc35934b671bd81"`



  **How to Generate the Checksum**:
  - Use the `md5sum` command on the license file:
    ```bash
    md5sum <license_file>
    ```
    Example:
    ```bash
    md5sum ~/yocto/poky/meta/files/common-licenses/MIT
    ```
    Output:
    ```bash
    0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302  MIT
    ```

	**Example**:
	```bash
	LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COREBASE}/meta/files/common-licenses/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302"
    ```


- **Using Checksum for Downloaded Files**
  - The integrity of downloaded files is ensured through the use of SHA256 checksums, which must not be overlooked.
    ```bash
    SRC_URI[sha256sum] = "c8a61c9acf76fa7eb4239e89f640dee3e87098d9f69b4d3518c9c60fc6d20c55"
    ```

### **4. Common Hidden Local Variables**

- **PV (Package Version)**
  - This variable holds the version number of the package.
  - Example: `PV = "1.0.0"`

- **PR (Package Revision)**
  - Indicates the revision of the package, a critical detail in version management.
  - Example: `PR = "r0"`

- **PN (Package Name)**
  - Specifies the name of the package.
  - Example: `PN = "example-package"`

### **5. Naming Conventions for Recipes**

- The correct naming of recipe files is fundamental to the organization and management of your Yocto project. The standard naming convention is `PN_PV_PR.bb`.
  - **Example**: `example-package_1.0.0_r0.bb`

### **6. Directories in Yocto Recipes**

- **S (Source Directory)**
  - The `S` variable points to the directory where BitBake unpacks the source files, a crucial step in the build process.
  - Example: `S = "${WORKDIR}/git"`

- **B (Build Directory)**
  - The `B` variable specifies where the build process occurs, an essential detail in the compilation phase.
  - Example: `B = "${WORKDIR}/build"`

- **D (Destination Directory)**
  - The `D` variable is used to define where the final built files are staged before packaging.
  - Example: `D = "${WORKDIR}/install"`

### **7. Inspecting Variables in Yocto Recipes**

- **Using `bitbake -e` Command**
  - The `bitbake -e` command expands all variables within a recipe, showing how they are defined and what values they hold after all includes, overrides, and other modifications are applied.

  **Command Syntax**:
  ```bash
  bitbake -e <recipe_name>
  ```

  - **Filtering for Specific Variables**:
    - Example to find the value of the `S` variable:
      ```bash
      bitbake -e <recipe_name> | grep ^S=
      ```

  **More Examples**:
  - **To read the value of `PV`**:
    ```bash
    bitbake -e <recipe_name> | grep ^PV=
    ```

  - **To read the value of `PN`**:
    ```bash
    bitbake -e <recipe_name> | grep ^PN=
    ```

  - **To read the value of `PR`**:
    ```bash
    bitbake -e <recipe_name> | grep ^PR=
    ```

  - **To find the build directory `B`**:
    ```bash
    bitbake -e <recipe_name> | grep ^B=
    ```

  - **To find the destination directory `D`**:
    ```bash
    bitbake -e <recipe_name> | grep ^D=
    ```

### **8. Global Variables in Yocto**

- **COREBASE**
  - The `COREBASE` variable points to the base directory of the Yocto environment, an anchor point for the entire build system.
  - Example: `COREBASE = "/home/user/yocto/poky"`

- **TMPDIR**
  - The top-level build output directory, a global variable that must be correctly configured.

- **MULTIMACH_TARGET_SYS**
  - Identifies the target system for cross-compilation, a crucial detail for multi-machine builds.

- **EXTENDPE**
  - Manages versioning through the epoch, which is typically blank unless `PE` is set, an important consideration in recipe management.

### **9. BitBake Workflow**

- **Input**: BitBake takes a `.bb` file as its primary input. This file, known as a recipe, contains metadata and instructions on how to fetch, configure, compile, and package software for a target system.

- **Processing**:
  - BitBake processes the `.bb` file, expanding variables and executing the tasks defined in the recipe. It handles the entire lifecycle from fetching the source to building and packaging it.
  - BitBake also handles dependencies, ensuring that all required components are built in the correct order.

- **Output**:
  - The output of BitBake is typically a package or set of packages that can be installed on the target machine. These packages can be in formats like `.ipk`, `.rpm`, or `.deb`, depending on the configuration.
  - The final executable or software package is suitable for deployment on the target system, which could be an embedded device or any other system supported by the Yocto Project.


  


### **10.  process of downloading and unpacking sources**


1. **Downloading Sources**:
   - The `do_fetch()` task in BitBake is responsible for downloading source files. These files are typically specified in the recipe using variables like `SRC_URI`.
   - For example, if you have a tarball specified in `SRC_URI`, BitBake will download this tarball to the `DL_DIR` directory, which is usually defined as `~/yocto-build/downloads`.

   ```bitbake
   SRC_URI = "http://example.com/source.tar.gz"
   ```

   In this case, `source.tar.gz` will be downloaded into the `DL_DIR`.

2. **Unpacking Sources**:
   - Once the files are downloaded, the `do_unpack()` task is responsible for unpacking these files into the `S` directory, which stands for "Source Directory".
   - The `S` directory is where the unpacked source code is placed and where the subsequent tasks (like configuring, compiling, and installing) will operate.
   - The default location for `S` is inside the build directory, typically something like `~/yocto-build/tmp/work/<arch>/<package>/1.0-r0/`, but this can be overridden in the recipe.

   ```bitbake
   S = "${WORKDIR}/source"
   ```

   In this case, `source.tar.gz` will be unpacked into the `S` directory specified by `WORKDIR` plus `source`.

### Example Recipe

Here’s a simplified example of a Yocto recipe to illustrate the process:

```bitbake
DESCRIPTION = "Sample application"
LICENSE = "MIT"
SRC_URI = "http://example.com/source.tar.gz"
S = "${WORKDIR}/source"

do_fetch() {
    # This task downloads the source file
    # BitBake automatically handles this based on SRC_URI
    bb.build.exec_func('do_fetch', d)
}

do_unpack() {
    # This task unpacks the source file
    # BitBake automatically handles this based on S
    bb.build.exec_func('do_unpack', d)
}

do_configure() {
    # Configuration steps here
}

do_compile() {
    # Compilation steps here
}

do_install() {
    # Installation steps here
}
```

### Summary

- **`do_fetch()`**: Downloads the source files to `DL_DIR`.
- **`do_unpack()`**: Unpacks the files from `DL_DIR` into the `S` directory for further processing.

You don’t usually need to manually unpack files; BitBake handles this based on the recipe's configuration.
