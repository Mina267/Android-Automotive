# BusyBox Linking: Static vs Dynamic

## Introduction

BusyBox is a versatile collection of UNIX utilities often called the "Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux." It combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable, making it ideal for embedded systems.

This document explains the differences between building BusyBox with static linking versus dynamic linking, and how each approach impacts dependencies, size, portability, memory usage, and maintenance.

## Static Linking

### Overview

When BusyBox is built *statically*:
- **Dependencies**: All libraries and dependencies required by BusyBox are included directly within the BusyBox binary.
- **Size**: The resulting binary is larger as it contains all the necessary code for its dependencies.
- **Portability**: The binary is highly portable, able to run on any system with the same architecture without requiring additional libraries.
- **Memory Usage**: Each instance of BusyBox includes its own copy of the libraries, potentially leading to higher overall memory usage if multiple instances run simultaneously.
- **Maintenance**: Updating a library means recompiling BusyBox with the updated library, resulting in a new binary.

### Execution Characteristics

#### Process:
1. **Loading**: The entire BusyBox binary, including all necessary library code, is loaded into RAM.
2. **Memory Usage**: All dependencies are part of the binary, so no separate library loading is required.
3. **Execution**: The command is executed using the code within the BusyBox binary.

#### Characteristics:
- **Single Binary Load**: The entire binary is loaded into memory.
- **Consistency**: Each command instance loads its complete copy of BusyBox into RAM.
- **Redundancy**: Higher memory usage due to each instance having its own copy of the required code.
- **Performance**: Potentially faster startup as there is no need to resolve dynamic dependencies.

## Dynamic Linking

### Overview

When BusyBox is built *dynamically*:
- **Dependencies**: The binary relies on external shared libraries present on the system.
- **Size**: The resulting binary is smaller as it does not include the actual code for its dependencies.
- **Portability**: The binary is less portable as it depends on the presence of required shared libraries.
- **Memory Usage**: Multiple instances of BusyBox commands can share the same copy of the shared libraries in memory.
- **Maintenance**: Updating a shared library benefits all applications using it, without needing to recompile BusyBox.

### Execution Characteristics

#### Process:
1. **Loading**: The BusyBox binary is loaded into RAM.
2. **Dynamic Linking**: The dynamic linker resolves the necessary shared libraries and loads them into memory if not already loaded.
3. **Memory Sharing**: Shared libraries are reused across multiple instances if already loaded.
4. **Execution**: The command is executed using the code within the BusyBox binary and the shared libraries.

#### Characteristics:
- **Binary and Library Load**: Both BusyBox binary and required shared libraries are loaded into memory.
- **Shared Memory**: Libraries are loaded once and shared among all processes needing them.
- **Efficiency**: Lower memory usage due to shared library code among multiple command instances.
- **Dependency Management**: Slight overhead due to resolving symbols and loading libraries at runtime.

## Comparison Summary

| Aspect | Static Linking | Dynamic Linking |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Binary Size** | Larger | Smaller |
| **Portability** | High | Low |
| **Memory Usage** | Higher per instance | Lower per instance (shared libraries) |
| **Startup Time** | Potentially faster | Potentially slower (dynamic linking overhead) |
| **Maintenance** | Requires recompilation for updates | Easier updates without recompilation |

## Conclusion

Each approach has its trade-offs. Static linking is preferred for highly constrained or isolated environments where library availability cannot be guaranteed. Dynamic linking is useful in environments where disk space is limited but shared libraries are reliably available.

## How to Build BusyBox

### Static Linking
To build BusyBox with static linking, use the following configuration:
```sh
make menuconfig
# Enable "Build static binary (no shared libs)"
make
```

### Dynamic Linking
To build BusyBox with dynamic linking, use the default configuration:
```sh
make menuconfig
# Ensure "Build static binary (no shared libs)" is disabled
make
```
