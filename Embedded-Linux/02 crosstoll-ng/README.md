```

## Configure the Toolchain
In the `menuconfig` interface, navigate through the menus and configure the following options:

1. **Select the Library:**
   - Navigate to `C-library` and select the desired C library (e.g., `glibc`, `uClibc`, or `musl`).

2. **Enable GDB:**
   - Navigate to `Debug facilities` and select `gdb` to include GDB in the toolchain.

3. **Enable Strace:**
   - Navigate to `Debug facilities` and select `strace` to include strace in the toolchain.

4. **Enable C++:**
   - Navigate to `Languages` and ensure `C++` support is enabled.

## Build the Toolchain
Once you have configured the toolchain to your satisfaction, exit the `menuconfig` interface and save your changes. Then, build the toolchain:
```bash
./ct-ng build
```

This process will take some time as it downloads and builds the necessary components for the toolchain.

## Verify Installation
After the build completes, you can verify the installation and check the toolchain binaries in the specified installation directory.
